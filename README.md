# JumpCityAviation

Jump City Aviation is a website project that I did in SNHU IT - 270. This course, I took as a free elective because I wanted more
hands on experience with HTML and CSS. The overall layout for this site needs some improvement, mainly, I wish to add some Bootstrap
classes. I mostly want to do this for the navigation and grid items due to when I try to show others, especially on my phone, 
it is appearent that it needs a modern touch.
