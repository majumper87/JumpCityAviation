				<p>
					The purpose of this site is to demonstrate an understanding of HTML and CSS. By taking bits and pieces of what could be considered an average layout, I then used CSS to make my own adjustments to the design. Some of the features or structures included are seen with the navigation, grid containers, tables, and forms. All photos are stock photos from <a href="https://www.pexels.com/">pexels.com</a>, a text file has been included in the img directory of this site.
				</p>
				<p>
					For the navigation, I first decided on lining up the links to other pages on the right side by using float right. Normally, this is seen on the left, but I decided that would be a better area for the name of the company. I did this mostly because people tend to look in the direction they read - left to right. I also included indentation of 1% for the name and padding for all of the navigation text, along with a hover to change the color of the area.
				</p>
				<p>
					For the overall design of the website, I chose to make a logo - <a href="https://logo.com/">logo.com</a> - for the company and have it seen throughout the website by utilizing the opacity feature. There were a few choices, but I chose the black background with a light grey for the body background for contrast. On the home page, I wrote a basic description of the company with a couple of pictures that are offset from right to left, along with the text, as the user scrolls down the page. 
				</p>
				<p>
					For the Flights page, I included an example file that I found on <a href="https://file-examples.com/">file-examples.com</a>. This is for the video element, which I also gave it the attributes to load first and also to loop. For the flight options, I used the grid element to autofit four columns. As the screen gets wider or larger, the columns will adjust themselves below the first element of the row above it. The future goal would be to have the ability to select the flight tour that would lead to a separate page for further scheduling. For now, the form below has a form to include first and last name, along with an email. It also includes the selection for either flight, and if chosen, add-ons to the flight (dinner/flowers). Lastly, an input of a date is included with the form for submission. All fields, excluding the add-ons, are set to be required before being able to submit the form.
				</p>
				<p>
					The services page does not have much to it except a simple table. The table will be able to include a further breakdown of services, but is initially broken down between mechanical and instrumental work. Such services that could be included is basic tune-up of the engine (oil/spark plugs) along with other related jobs related to fuel mixtures, propellers, flaps and ailerons, elevators and trims, and rudders. The instruments would include such items as the Garmin instrument panels - G1000, G3000, etc. - and other electrical systems related to the avionics. The tabel data is set up to adjust with the size of the screen by given a percentage value of 33%. The text is set to align-left to overwrite the main body value of align-center.
				</p>
				<p>
					The contacts page is another simple table. This is for the user to be able to contact the separate departments of the company. The list contains a contact to a main receptionist for customer service, maintenance department, and basic inquiries. The table is set up in the same mannor as the Service table set with the site.css file. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Lastly is the css for the about page. The page simply takes on the form of the body css. The mostly notable difference, which was placed in my 'main p' tags for the body, is the use of an indent value of 5% to simulate a paragraph indentation.
